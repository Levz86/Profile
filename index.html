    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>My name is Levina Premnand. i am a wife to Suneel Premnand, and a mum to Aradhya Premnand. i have a Btech in Veterinary Technology and have lived in Durban for 8 years not. previous to that i lived in Pretoria with my parents. i completed my studies at TUT. and lived in London for a year while living on a farm. I decided to take on a new vent and studying to become a software developer. it was definately a challenge for me, having a full time job and being a mum to a 4 year. i love cooking and baking in my spare time. and i love trying new things. i have recently also discovered i have a love for gardening. i work in a laboratory as a veterinary technologist. and since my baby was born i find it difficult to make tme to do the things i love. (ie gym, execise, yoga) so i dicided to study something that i could do as a work from home job. in hopes to have more time to do the things i love and spend more time with my daughter.</p>
